numbers prefixed with $ = hex
prefixed with # = literal number value
Any other number = a memory location.

LOL in js you can denote hex by prepending a 0x. derp.

I'm confused about how the PC and memory relate
memory = {
  0: 'opcode value', // do we allocate memory at location 0 until we run out?
  1: '....', // then go to 1?
  100: ''
}
